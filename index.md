Have a web app already. Build an iOS and Android mobile app within a week with your existing web app. Supercharge the mobile app with push notifications, camera, and file access and other native features.

## Check if webtonative.app is for you?

* You are building an information production.
* You already have a beautiful mobile web and don't want to write the code for the native mobile app again.
* Know Javascript or willing to learn Javascript.
* Want to notify your mobile users via push notification.
* Figuring out the details of building the mobile apps is too daunting and don't have the bandwidth for it.
* You want to use some of the mobile hardware sensors and can't do that with a web app.

## Stack

We desinged the stack keeping in mind that minimal setup required on the native mobile side i.e. the app infrastructure. And all your business logic stays in the serverside, i.e. server rendered htmls.

Central components of this architecture are Expo, Webviews and Server Rendered Html.
